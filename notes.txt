layout:
!* dont use position:relative constantly
!* fixed > absolute > static > relative > float
!* floats kill static and relative by resizing them.
* :after and :before content vs normal dom
!* offsetWidth/Height calculates children constantly.
!* insert new elements AFTER changing all attributes and styles.
!* If you are just moving objects around in absolute space, do NOT remove the parent and readd it after. It is actually slower due to repaint.
* Fastest way to move elements: in a fixed layout, transform translate3d with absoluted positioning.
* translate3d > matrix3d > translate > matrix > left/top (sometimes)

!DocumentFragment:
!* Avoid all reflow and layout until added to document OR accessing internal values.
!* ALL css computed values are unusable (no calculations at all. very fast)
!** Try it out with window.getComputedStyle
!** Or child.offsetWidth and such


LAYOUT
<ul class="build">
<li>Fixed > absolute > static > relative > float</li>
        <li><b>Remember</b> JavaScript properties can do a lot of work <b>just by accessing them</b></li>
        <li><b>Cache</b> computed values (offset/client properties) if possible</li>
        <li><b>Use</b> DocumentFragment</li>
        <li><b>Do not use</b> the Remove/Re-add Rule in GPU mode</li>
        <li>Edit element properties <b>before</b> adding them to the DOM tree</li>
      </ul>


PAINTING
<ul class="build">
        <li>Painting is difficult to optimize</li>
        <li>Check the developer tools timeline feature</li>
        <li>Avoid shadow related CSS</li>
      </ul>

COMPOSITING
<ul class="build">
        <li><b>Use</b> GPU mode if possible</li>
        <li><b>Imagine</b> all objects are textures</li>
        <li><b>Test</b> for devices that have bugs in GPU mode</li>
        <li><b>Do not use</b> the Remove/Re-add Rule in GPU mode</li>
        <li><b>Be careful</b> about memory usage</li>
        <li><b>Remember</b> that textures are <b>destroyed</b> when their element is removed from  the DOM</li>
      </ul>

Canvas
<ul class="build">
        <li>Modern Canvas is <b>actually 3D</b></li>
        <li>Uses GPU mode</li>
        <li>Transforming paths and images is very fast</li>
        <li>Drawing raw paths is <b>not as fast</b> as <b>drawImage</b></li>
        <li><b>Always</b> use drawImage for everything</li>
        <li>Browsers are getting <b>smarter</b> and <b>faster</b> every day</li>
      </ul>
